📚 Current Projects
Credit Card Fraud Detection System
A machine learning-based project that uses historical credit card transaction data to detect fraudulent transactions. It leverages Supervised Learning algorithms and performs data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation.

Face Detection Attendance System
An automated attendance system using OpenCV and face detection technology. It identifies faces from a live camera feed and marks attendance based on detected faces. This system simplifies attendance tracking in classrooms and workplaces.

🌱 My Learning Journey
I’m continuously learning and growing in the field of software development and data science. Some of my current learning goals include:

Enhancing my Machine Learning and Deep Learning skills.
Building Real-World Data Science Projects to apply my knowledge.
Experimenting with new tools and technologies in web development and programming.
